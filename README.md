We believe that by now you got familiarised with all the required python modules necessary for our project and from now we are ready to start working on our project. We will be using Tensorflow and OpenCV opensource libraries for our project, so go through them once and we will be using *Siamese Neural Network* architecture in our project(Though it is also a CNN model, we will not be using advanced Pre-Processing or activation functions). So for the next two days, get familiarise with those libraries and the architecture. Please refer to the following document regarding the same.
[Siamese Neural Network.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20953388/Siamese.Neural.Network.pdf)

Also for using the Jupyter notebook, please download the Anaconda from the link below:
