# SOC25_FacialRecognition

<h3>CS101-Slides:</h3>
Hi everyone, 

As many of haven't used python previously, we will start by learn python first; for the next two weeks and then later on we can start learning modules/frameworks that are essential for the project.
To kick things off, please take a day to recall all the topics that you have learnt in CS101 and then from tomorrow we can learn python. 

Incase if you don't have access to your lecture slides, please find the slides in the drive link given below, but remember that these a bit different from the ones you studied. Focus on the logic & flowcharts rather than syntax.
Here you go!

<h3>Basic-Python-modules:</h3>

We believe that by now you have completed learning the basics and get familiarised with the python. It's time to gear-up the things and start learning the modules and frameworks that are crucial for our project.

Please find attached the document below covering the required modules for the project with links to their learning resources. And try to complete them in 1 week.[Basic_Python_Modules.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20953335/Basic_Python_Modules.docx)

<h3>Siamese-Neural-Network:</h3>

We believe that by now you got familiarised with all the required python modules necessary for our project and from now we are ready to start working on our project. We will be using Tensorflow and OpenCV opensource libraries for our project, so go through them once and we will be using *Siamese Neural Network* architecture in our project(Though it is also a CNN model, we will not be using advanced Pre-Processing or activation functions). So for the next two days, get familiarise with those libraries and the architecture. Please refer to the following document regarding the same.

Also for using the Jupyter notebook, please download the Anaconda from the link below:

If you face any difficulties while downloading or else you have any queries regarding the Midterm checkpoint submission, please feel free to reach out.
