Hi everyone, 

As many of haven't used python previously, we will start by learn python first; for the next two weeks and then later on we can start learning modules/frameworks that are essential for the project.
To kick things off, please take a day to recall all the topics that you have learnt in CS101 and then from tomorrow we can learn python. 

Incase if you don't have access to your lecture slides, please find the slides in the drive link given below, but remember that these a bit different from the ones you studied. Focus on the logic & flowcharts rather than syntax.
Here you go!
